# Online-Restaurant-Application
## This project is based upon an online restaurant web application where people can order food online.

This project is a web application with an aim to provide an entire online ordering section with various varieties of food. Its features include a customer login using their personal details and mobile number. The customer is then allowed to order whatever food he/she wishes to do to get delivered or can select an option for takeaway. The application is also made available for cancelling the customerâ€™s order. Using machine learning techniques, the customer will be able to place further orders based on the previously placed orders.
